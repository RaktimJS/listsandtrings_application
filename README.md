## About Me

Hi, my name is Raktim, and I'm a senior high school student from a Tier 3 town named Pathsala, in the state of Assam, India.

I'm very passionate about Computers and Mathematics, and I enjoy building systems that integrate Math with Computer Programming. As this program is the kind of project I enjoy working on the most, building it solo was a lot of fun!

This app is built completely using Python and utilizes almost every Python concept from the 11th grade CBSE Computer Science syllabus (and very few concepts from 12th grade Computer Science).

___

## How was this made?

1. The app is written entirely in Python and is split into two files:  
   - `lists_and_strings.py` (the main entry point)  
   - `module.py` (contains all the string/list handling functions)
2. Uses modular programming with custom imports to isolate core logic from user interface.
3. Applies string manipulation, conditional filtering, and basic data structure operations.
4. Allows multiple types of list modifications (insertion, deletion, merging, sorting).
5. Demonstrates robust CLI interaction and dynamic list editing through user input.

___

## What were the learnings?

1. Strengthened understanding of lists and string operations in Python.
2. Implemented filtering logic and manipulation of dynamic user-defined data.
3. Practiced modular programming by separating logic across files.
4. Applied color formatting and control sequences to make the CLI more interactive.
5. Learned how to make reusable functions for complex workflows using lists and strings.

## How to run the program?

- Make sure Python is installed and added to your system path.
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run the file: `lists_and_strings.py`
